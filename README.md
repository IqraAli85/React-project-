Purpose of project :
The idea behind this was that the gps tracker will track your location and bus location and will tell you how much time abd distance is left between you and the bus . By this you dont have to wait for the bus all day.
Also there is an admin side too where the admin can add the new bus route so that the user will know of the new routes and his journey will be easy
